# *Gryllus longicercus* structural and functional annotation.

*Gryllus longicercus* is a New World cricket living in rocky landscapes of deserts in western USA and Mexico. Here we present a notebook that contains 13 key steps of analysis for: <insert_doi>

## Annotation notebook:
1. Preparing RNAseq evidence for annotation.
2. Preparing protein evidence for annotation.
3. Genome masking.
4. Structural annotation: BRAKER3 run.
5. BLAST functional annotation.
6. InterProScan functional annotation.
7. Orthofinder Analysis.
8. BUSCO completeness analysis of transcripts.
9. Merging functional annotations.
10. BUSCO completeness analysis of assemblies.
11. Chosing the longest transcript per gene.
12. GFF feature counting function.
13. Putting gff annotations into file functions.

Steps 1 through 4 focus on structural annotation, steps 5, 6, 9, and 13 enrich the annotation with functional information. 
In addition, steps 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 contain other analyses performed for the project.
